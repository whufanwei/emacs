## Ace Jump Buffer

`ace-jump-buffer` is an extension for [`ace-jump-mode`](https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode) and the native `bs` buffer menu that lets you hop to Emacs buffers in two key strokes.

### Installation

Install from [MELPA](melpa.milkbox.net) with `package-install ace-jump-buffer`, or drop `ace-jump-buffer.el`, `ace-jump-mode.el`, and [`dash.el`](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el) into your load path.
